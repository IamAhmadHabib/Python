# LAB TASK 1
# REPLACE THE FIRST CHARACTER WITH SOME OTHER

# a = "Kratos Zeus"
# print (a.replace("s", "z"))


# LAB TASK 2
# REMOVE ALL THE ODD INDEX CHARACTERS OF STRING

# a = "Kratos Zeus"
# print (a[::2])

# LAB TASK 3
# Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string

# a = input ("Enter your First Name")
# b = input ("Enter your Last Name")
# METHOD 1
# c = a[2:]
# d = b[2:]
# e = a[:2]
# f = b[:2]
# g = f + c
# h = e + d
# print(g + " " + h)

# METHOD # 2
# c = (b [:2] + a [2:]  + " " + a[:2] + b[2:] )
# print (c)


# LAB TASK 4
# Write a Python program to print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements.

# list1 = ["Ahmad", 20 , 30 ,"LAST NAME", 1000, "BOMBAY PHENOTYPE", 124]
# # print (list1[1:4])
# list2 = list1[1:4]
# print (list2 + list1[6:])

# LAB TASK 1
# write a program to print all natural numbers from 1 to n 

# x = 1 
# while (x < x+1):
#     print ("The value of x" , x)
#     x = x+1

# LAB TASK 2
# Write a program to print all even numbers from 1 to 100

# x = 2
# while x <= 100 and x % 2 == 0 :
#     # if x % 2 == 0:
#         print ("The even numbers would be from 1 to 100:", x)
#         x=x+2

# LAB TASK 3 
# Write a program to ask user input for a number. Check if it is a prime number. If it is, end the program but if it is not ask for the user input again till the user enters a prime number.
